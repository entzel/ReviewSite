A rails web app for social reviewing

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/957846/overview

## Project Proposal

### Goals
The project is to create a review website of local businesses. The user can search through a map of Boulder and click on businesses and be taken to an information/review page for that business. The user can make a profile that stores their reviews and allows them to write reviews for businesses. The user can search through a list of businesses, and can sort and filter the businesses by some categories. 

### Views
Login Page, Homepage/Index, User profile page, Edit/Create review page, Business review page, Map view of businesses

### Stakeholders
Businesses being reviewed, Users who write reviews, Users who want to look at reviews

### The Team's Competency
Using the google map API and framework from the rottenpotatoes software project, we have the necessary tools to create a similar review website, with local businesses already populated. We want a similar difficulty level to the default project but with a different focus.
